	<h1>Technologies and Programming of Web Applications</h1>
	<p> Hello I am Kostas and this is the website I created for the couse of Technologies and Programming of Web Applications. Even though I don't follow this course I decided that it would be a good idea to complete the project as it will help me acquire more knowledge about web development in general. The following links are 7 webpages where I have to create something based on the title. I used the Emmet plugin of Sublime text to help me write the HTML and CSS code and Git to upload the code to Github.</p>
