	<h2>Greetings</h2>
	<p>My name is Konstantinos Kivotos and I am a 21 years old student currently studying Informatics at Athens University of Economics and Business or AUEB. I chose those studies because technologie was constantly becoming more and more sophisticated and I wanted to also be a part of this, learn programming and technology related courses, learn how things I use everyday work like a computer, the Internet etc. I am now on my fourth year of studies and as I finish my degree more and more I want to do an internship to a big company like Google. Some of my skills include: </p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Good knowledege: </b></li>
		<li> Java, C++ ,Python</li>
	</ul>
	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Average knowledege</b></li>
		<li>Assembly, Go, Linux, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Linux</li>
	</ul>

	Aside from that though I am open to new languages and things I have never learned before, that's why I am making this site as example. I am also trying to learn frameworks which will help me with my career like Spring Core.
