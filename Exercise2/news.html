	<h2>Nice to hear that you want to know my news</h2>

	<h3>18 of April 2020</h3>
	<p>Today is the Easter for us in Greece and I had some lamp with tzatziki and other delicasies. Pretty weird not be able to go out on Easter but we have to do what's possible becasuse the times are difficult. </p>

	<h3>18 of April 2020</h3>
	<p>So far with the Corona pandemic I am way more focused on my university and also determined to get some hard skills to help me with my career. I have bought a Machine Learning class from Udemy which I though would be nice as I have plenty of time right now and so far it's going good. Also I am using the free accounts to some other teaching sites. I am also reading some books from time to time, the one right now is Agnes Gray from Anne BrontÃ«. Unfortunately though I have a lot of projects from the uni which I also have to do, if everything goes good I will have finished my degree in the next semester from now but we will see.</p>

	<p>Don't know what else to write so here is a photo of my university!</p>
